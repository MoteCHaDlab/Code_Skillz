# Code_Skillz
 
 Collection of bi-weekly code materials presented during Mote Marine Lab's Coral Health and Disease program's Code SkillZ workshops. During the summer of 2021, we are meeting every other week on Friday after lab meetings (12pm). Please contact Sara with any topic suggestions!
 
 If you are presenting a topic, please create a sub-folder in this repository to share your code materials. Please use open data as much as possible for any tutorials or examples that you make, unless you are sharing something specific to your research. Please be aware that this repository is **Public** when adding materials.  
 
 Manager: Sara Williams (swilliams@mote.org).
 
### Upcoming Code Skillz

July 9th: Canceled

July 23rd: ggplot and data visualization

### Past Code Skillz

April 2021: Microbial analysis pipeline (see microbes_pipeline repository)

June 11th: Samara & heat-trees

June 25th: Sara & data exploration


### Organization (add folder descriptions here)

HeatTrees folder: contains the code for heat trees, and a couple of the heat trees saved as pdf or .png since RNotebooks struggle to see heat treees. Heat trees are a heatmap imposed on a cladogram. They are a great way to see abundances as well as what the diversity is and where it lies within the cladogram.

DataExploration folder: code on initial data exploration using base R and tidyverse

DataViz: code on different data visualizations and plotting. Initial code includes a notebook on barplots.
