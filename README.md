# Code_Skillz
 
 Collection of bi-weekly code materials presented during Mote Marine Lab's Coral Health and Disease program's Code SkillZ workshops. During the summer of 2021, we are meeting every other week on Friday after lab meetings (12pm). Please contact Sara with any topic suggestions!
 
 If you are presenting a topic, please create a sub-folder in this repository to share your code materials. Please use open data as much as possible for any tutorials or examples that you make, unless you are sharing something specific to your research.
 
 Please be aware that this repository is *Public* and it is managed by Sara Williams (swilliams@mote.org).
